# CS300

The purpose of the course CS300 was to utilize different data structures such as vectors, hash tables, linked lists, and binary search trees. 

I overcame challenges by utilizing error code searches, zybooks material, and other resources that could help me come to a conclusion. 

My work on this project has helped me better understand how the different data structure types could be useful for different programs. 

My work on this project has helped me create more organized, effecient C++ code. I have also improved in-line comments to help understand the program and what I am trying to achieve.
